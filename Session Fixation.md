Here is a vulnerable Java code snippet that is susceptible to Session Fixation attack:

## ðŸ¥º Vulnerable Code
```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
String sessionId = request.getParameter("sessionId");

if (sessionId != null) {
session.setId(sessionId);
}
```
This code is vulnerable to session fixation attacks because it allows an attacker to specify the session ID that should be used for the userâ€™s session. An attacker could potentially fixate a userâ€™s session by sending them a link with a malicious session ID, and then use that session ID to impersonate the user and gain access to their session.

## ðŸ˜Ž Secure Code
To secure the code against session fixation attacks, you should not allow the session ID to be specified by the client. Instead, you should generate a new, unique session ID for the user when they log in, and store it in a secure cookie that is not accessible to the client.

```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
String sessionId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

session.setId(sessionId);

Cookie cookie = new Cookie("sessionId", sessionId);
cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
cookie.setSecure(true);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```
This secure code generates a new, unique session ID for the user when they log in, and stores it in a secure cookie. The session ID is not accessible to the client, which helps to prevent session fixation attacks.
